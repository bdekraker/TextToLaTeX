## üîß How It Works

1.  **Parsing:** A simple, custom JavaScript function parses the input text. It recognizes basic Markdown syntax (headings, lists, bold text, horizontal rules) and converts it into corresponding HTML tags. LaTeX blocks (`$...$` and `$$...$$`) are left untouched.
2.  **Rendering:** The generated HTML is injected into the main content area of the page.
3.  **Typesetting:** The MathJax library is then invoked to scan the new content and transform all LaTeX blocks into high-quality, SVG-based mathematical notation.
4.  **Theming:** Light and dark modes are handled efficiently using CSS Variables. A `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` tag toggles between two sets of color variables, and the user's choice is persisted via `localStorage`.
5.  **Exporting:**
    *   The "Print" button triggers the browser's native print dialog, using a special `@media print` stylesheet to format the output.
    *   The "Save as PDF" button uses the `html2pdf.js` library to capture the rendered HTML content (including the SVG math) and compile it into a PDF file for download.
